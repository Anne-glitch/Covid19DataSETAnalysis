# Covid19DataSETAnalysis
Here I have used the dataset containig the information on the number of cases that were-confirmed,recovored and reported deaths across the globe of various different countries.
With the use of python and its multiple libraries such as pandas,seaborn and numpy, I have picked up certain criteria and cases for the dataset and represented them here.
The csv file contains the data of different regions/countries across the globe and their number of cases that are confirmed, recovered and the number of reported casualties.
The original dataset was cleaned,i.e, only relevant and required info has been used from the original file downloaded.
